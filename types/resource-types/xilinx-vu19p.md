Amazon EC2 [F1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/) instances provide access to [Xilinx VU19P FPGA](](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/virtex-ultrascale-plus-vu19p.html) chips connected to the instance.

From the [Amazon website](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/)
> Amazon EC2 F1 instances use FPGAs to enable delivery of custom hardware accelerations.
> F1 instances are easy to program and come with everything you need to develop, simulate, debug, and compile your hardware acceleration code,
> including an FPGA Developer AMI and supporting hardware level development on the cloud.
> Using F1 instances to deploy hardware accelerations can be useful in many applications to solve complex science,
> engineering, and business problems that require high bandwidth, enhanced networking, and very high compute capabilities.
> Examples of target applications that can benefit from F1 instance acceleration are genomics, search/analytics, image and video processing,
> network security, electronic design automation (EDA), image and file compression and big data analytics.
